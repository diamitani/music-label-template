## Proactive Preventive Measures
1. **Disk Capacity Hygiene:** Periodically purge stale package caches (`npm cache clean --force`).
2. **Canvas / PDF.js Aliasing:** Ensure `next.config.mjs` aliases native node packages (`canvas: false`) when using PDF viewers.
3. **Defensive Schema Parsing:** Always validate field types when parsing user and platform states.
4. **Automated Session Summary Hooks:** Keep `hooks.json` configured with the Stop hook to capture all incidents in real-time.
